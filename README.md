# Forest-Density-and-Happiness
Please download the powerpoint at https://github.com/Persephone007/Forest-Density-and-Happiness/blob/master/Does%20Forest%20Growth%20Correlate%20to%20Happiness.pptx  for an overview of this project.


In This project we rely heavily on Pandas, Matplotlib, Excel, and VBA to analyze if Forest Density (as tree canopy cover per person) has any relation to happiness metrics such as health, income, education, crime, and suicide rates.
